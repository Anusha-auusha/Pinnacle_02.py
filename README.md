# Alarm Clock with Customizable Tones and Snooze Options

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based alarm clock application that allows users to set alarms with customizable tones and snooze options. The application is built using tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and pygame for audio playback. It provides an intuitive interface for setting alarms, selecting sound files, and managing snooze functionality.

## Features
- Set Alarms: Specify the time for the alarm in HH format.
- Customizable Tones: Choose an audio file (WAV format) to use as the alarm sound.
- Snooze Option: Snooze the alarm for a user-defined duration.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive GUI for ease of use.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
- Pygame: For playing audio files.
- Datetime: For handling time and scheduling.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Pygame: Install the pygame library for audio playback using pip:
`pip install pygame`

## Installation
No additional installation steps are required besides installing pygame. Simply download the project files to your local machine.

## Running the Application
1. Run the Application:
- python alarm_clock.py
  
2.Using the Application:
- Set Alarm: Enter the alarm time in HH format.
- Browse Sound: Select an audio file in WAV format to use as the alarm tone.
- Set Alarm: Click "Set Alarm" to activate the alarm.
- Snooze: When the alarm rings, choose to snooze for a specified duration or stop the alarm.

## Results
The application successfully provides a functional alarm clock with the following capabilities:

- Alarm Scheduling: Users can set alarms for specific times.
- Customizable Alarms: Users can choose their preferred sound file for the alarm.
- Snooze Functionality: Users can snooze the alarm for a user-defined duration.

## Example Use Cases
- Setting an Alarm: Input the time and select a sound file to set an alarm.
- Snoozing: When the alarm rings, select "Snooze" to delay the alarm for a specified duration.

## Conclusion
The Alarm Clock with Customizable Tones and Snooze Options project is a practical tool for managing alarms with personalized audio and snooze features. It demonstrates effective use of Python's tkinter for GUI development and pygame for audio handling.

While the application meets the core requirements, future enhancements could include:

- Persistent Alarms: Save alarm settings to a file or database for persistence across sessions.
- Advanced Features: Support for recurring alarms, notifications, or integration with system reminders.
- Improved UI: Refine the user interface with additional features and better design elements.
  
This project serves as a solid foundation for building more complex and feature-rich alarm clock applications.
