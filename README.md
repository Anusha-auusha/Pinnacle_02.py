# Monthly Calendar with Reminders

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based desktop application that displays a monthly calendar, allowing users to set and manage reminders for specific dates. The application is built using the tkinter library, providing a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Users can navigate through different months, set reminders on any date, and easily see which dates have reminders set.

## Features
- Monthly Calendar Display: Shows the days of the current month, with navigation options to move between months.
- Reminder Management: Users can set reminders for specific days. Days with reminders are highlighted in yellow on the calendar.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application uses a straightforward interface, making it accessible and easy to use.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
- Datetime: For handling and manipulating date and time information.
- Calendar: For generating and displaying calendar data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
  
## Installation
No additional installations are required, as tkinter is included with Python by default. Simply download the project files to your local machine.

## Running the Application
1. Run the Application:
- python calendar_app.py

2. Using the Application:
- A window will open showing the calendar for the current month.
- Use the < and > buttons to navigate between months.
- Click on any day to set a reminder. Days with reminders are highlighted in yellow.

## Results
The application successfully allows users to:
- View a monthly calendar for any month and year.
- Set and manage reminders for specific days.
- Easily navigate between months using the provided buttons.

## Example Usage
- Setting a Reminder: Click on a day in the calendar, enter a reminder in the prompt, and the day will be highlighted in yellow.
- Viewing Reminders: Hover over or click on highlighted days to view the reminder for that day.

## Conclusion
The Monthly Calendar with Reminders project is a functional and practical tool for basic scheduling and date management. It offers a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to keep track of important dates and events. While it provides core functionality, it also serves as a foundation for more advanced features such as persistent storage, daily or weekly views, and reminder notifications.

This project demonstrates the use of Python’s tkinter library for GUI development, along with basic date handling using Python’s datetime and calendar modules. It is a solid starting point for anyone looking to build more complex calendar applications.
